Extendible AngularJS two-way binding support for Polymer 1 elements and web components.

This Project was founded to preserve Gabriel Axel's repository (ng-polymer-elements) and extend support for further versions of Google's Polymer. The development is currently slow and dependent on the GitHub & Iniftar Foundations community. If you are interested in working on this project as a Full Contributor member, please head to GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to post your ideas and comments.
